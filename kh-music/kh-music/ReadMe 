This project is my capstone project for CodeLouisville's Front End Web Development course. 

For my project, I've created a website for a preformer who needed a portolio/ artist page.
It's a central location for people to find out who she is, what she does, and what what she can offer. It has a fairly simple design, as to not distract from the content.  

This site showcases HTML, CSS, and javascript. It uses a bootstrap framework grid system. It was designed for mobile first, but is responsive on most screen sizes.
